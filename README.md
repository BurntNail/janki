# Janki

## Binary Use
Currently CLI-only, so to run go `cargo run --bin janki_cli`

Plans for more versions later:
 - TUI
 - egui WASM support

## Library Use
This should be on crates.io, and is decently documented, at least for one of my projects.
Feel free to use the binaries as examples.

## TODO/Future Plans:
 - generics for the `Fact` struct
 - Docu-Tests/Examples
 - The new binaries
 - Better Cargo.toml Keywords and Categories
